## About Myself
I accidentally found out about wonderful The Rolling Scopes School and their cool JavaScript/Front-end course. Tried to study it, but failed because of the great difficulty for me. Fortunately there was the JS/FE Stage0.

So I'm happy to learn Front-end in Pre-School and determined to reach the victorious end!
